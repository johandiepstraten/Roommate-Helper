# WeClean

Problem: 
Living together with friends or other students can be a lot of fun. 
However, sometimes the house/shared rooms gets messy very quickly.
Living in a dirty environment can get unhealthy, therefore it's important to work together.
But it can be hard to keep track of who needs to clean what.

Solution:
The WeClean app allows you to make groups with your roommates and define the tasks that need to be done in your common rooms. 
You can decide how often tasks need to be done and the app will equally divide them among all group members.
Each group member gets to see their current task and can sign off when the task is completed.
The app will also send notifications if the deadline is close.
