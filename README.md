## Summary:
The Roommate Helper app lets you create a group with your roommates. You can define task and state how often you want them to be performed. The app will divide them equally and show users what task they have to do and when. Roommates can also keep track of a shared grocery list.

## Problem: 
Living together with friends or other students is a lot of fun. 
However, with everyone living their own lives, the house/shared rooms can get chaotic.
Living in a messy environment can be unhealthy, therefore it's important to work together.
But it can be hard to keep track of who needs to do what.

## Solution:
The Roommate Helper app allows you to make groups with your roommates and define the tasks that need to be done in your common rooms. 
You can decide how often tasks need to be done and the app will equally divide them among all group members.
Each group member gets to see their current task and can sign off when the task is completed.
The app also allows roommates to keep track of a shared grocery list. Everyone can add items to the grocery list and delete these items once bought.
