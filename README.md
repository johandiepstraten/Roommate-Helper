# Roommate Helper          Johan Diepstraten          10774920

# Summary:
The Roommate Helper app lets you create a group with your roommates. You can define task and state how often you want them to be performed. The app will divide them equally and notify users what task they have to do and when. 

# Problem: 
Living together with friends or other students can be a lot of fun. 
However, with everyone living their own lives, the house/shared rooms can get chaotic.
Living in a messy environment can be unhealthy, therefore it's important to work together.
But it can be hard to keep track of who needs to do what.

# Solution:
The Roommate Helper app allows you to make groups with your roommates and define the tasks that need to be done in your common rooms. 
You can decide how often tasks need to be done and the app will equally divide them among all group members.
Each group member gets to see their current task and can sign off when the task is completed.
The app will also send notifications if the deadline is close.

# Prerequisites:
The app gives users the possibility to create groups with their roommates. For each group data is stored to which all group members have access. This group-structure of the app is similar to the "Wiebetaaltwat" app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.wiebetaaltwat.webapp). The hard part of designing the app will be to let users create their own accounts and groups. Furthermore, sending notifications to users at the appropriate time will be difficult to implement. 

Possible additions to the app include:
- Let groups keep track of a shared shopping list.
- Allow users to be part of multiple groups.
- Let groups keep track of shared expenses.
